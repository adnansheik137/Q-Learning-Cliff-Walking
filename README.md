# Q-Learning-Cliff-Walking
Welcome to the Q-Learning Cliff Walking project! In this endeavor, we utilize reinforcement learning techniques to find the shortest path through a cliff walking maze.

## Environment Description

The environment in this project comprises states, actions, and rewards, forming the foundation of our reinforcement learning task. The agent receives states and actions as inputs and outputs possible actions to navigate through the environment.

- **States**: The environment consists of 30 tiles arranged in 5 rows and 6 columns, with a goal marked as "Goal," a cliff area marked as a gray box, and a safe route denoted by white boxes.

- **Actions**: The agent's actions involve choosing a direction to move, such as up, down, left, or right.

- **Rewards**: The agent receives rewards based on its actions and interactions with the environment. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards while avoiding negative rewards associated with falling off the cliff.

## Training the AI Model

The training of our AI model is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Helper Functions

To facilitate the training process, we've developed a set of helper functions to manage the interaction between the agent and the environment. These functions play a crucial role in enabling our AI to learn from its experiences and make informed decisions.

### 2. Training the AI Model

We employ Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to train our AI model. Q-Learning helps the agent learn the optimal policy by iteratively updating a Q-table that estimates the expected rewards for each state-action pair. The training process aims to find an efficient path through the maze while avoiding the cliff.

## Efficient Path Discovery

After training our AI model, we utilize the Q-table to determine the coordinates of the most efficient path from the start to the goal. The reinforcement learning process allows our AI to navigate the cliff walking maze intelligently.

Feel free to explore the code, notebooks, and documentation in this repository to understand the inner workings of our Q-Learning-based shortest-path planning solution. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome as we continue to enhance our reinforcement learning algorithms.
